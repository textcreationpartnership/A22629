            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Kings moſt Excellent MAJESTIE having taken into</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the manifold abuſes, in the mixtures, and falſifying of Wines, by Coopers and others, who of late yeers have aſſumed the Trade of buying and ſelling of Wines in groſſe, and by retail, being the proper Trades of Merchants, &amp; Vintners of the Realm, to the deceipt and dammage of His Subjects; and being minded to provide for reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein, by reducing the Trade and dealing for Wines to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Vintners of the Kingdome according to ancient cuſtome and right, who the eleventh day of Iune laſt have thereupon aſſented and agreed to anſwer His Majeſtie forty ſhillings upon every Tunne of Wines, which they ſhall import or ſell in groſſe, or by retail:</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie therefore intending the regulation of the ſaid Trade of Wines, and the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch mixtures and other frauds and abuſes therein; Is pleaſed (with the advice of His Privy Counſell) to declare His Royall pleaſure therein, and doth therefore hereby ſtraitly charge and command, that no perſon whatſoever, now uſing, or which hereafter ſhall uſe the Trade of a Cooper, ſhall by himſelf, ſervants, or any other for him, or to his uſe, from henceforth uſe the Trade of buying or ſelling of any ſort of Wines whatſoever within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Port and Town of <hi>Barwick,</hi> upon pain of His Majeſties high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and ſuch penalties and puniſhments as ſhall be thought meet to be inflicted upon the Offenders, for their contempt of His Majeſties Royall Commandment herein.</p>
            <p>And to the end that hereafter none but good and wholſome Wines may be uttered and ſold
<pb facs="tcp:28671:2"/>within the Realm, His Majeſties pleaſure is, that any two or more of the ſworn Searchers of the Company of Vintners of <hi>London,</hi> or any other perſons by them authoriſed under their common Seal, may enter into the Houſes, Vaults, Cellers, or other places of or belonging to any Merchants, Vintners, or other Retailers of Wines within the ſaid Realm, and there taſte and try any Wines, which they ſhall ſuſpect to be falſified or unwholſome, and may carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuch ſmall quantities of the ſaid ſuſpected Wines, as may ſerve for the triall thereof.</p>
            <p>And whereas aſwell the Merchants of <hi>London</hi> trading to <hi>Spain,</hi> as the Governour and Company of Merchants of <hi>London</hi> trading to <hi>France,</hi> and the Company of Vintners of <hi>London</hi> have ſeverally aſſented and agreed to anſwer his Majeſty fourty ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Tunne, for all ſuch Wines of what ſort ſoever, as they ſhall import and ſell in groſſe or by retail; His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie therefore willeth and commandeth all His Cuſtomers and other Officers in the Port of <hi>London,</hi> and the Members thereof, that no Entries be made, or Wines landed, before a Bill of Entrie be ſigned by ſuch as His Majeſty hath or ſhall appoint to receive the ſaid duety; And that no Merchants, Mariners, or other perſons His Majeſties naturall born Subjects, Denizens or Strangers, that ſhall hereafter ſell any Wines in groſſe to Vintners or others, ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ſuch Wines ſo ſold, before notice thereof be given to His Majeſties Officer in the ſaid Port appointed to receive the ſaid dutie, and his Certificate of ſatiſfaction for the ſame. And for ſuch Wines as any Merchants or other Importers ſhall fail to give ſuch notice of, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties will and pleaſure is, That in ſuch caſe the Merchants or Importers themſelves ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and pay the ſaid fourty ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Tunne, and ſo proportionably for every leſſer quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, at ſuch time as His Majeſties Receiver, who is or ſhall be appointed in that behalf, ſhall require the ſame, whom His Majeſty doth authorize to demand and receive the ſaid duety, and to take an accompt of the ſaid Merchants or Importers of Wines, to whom they diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the ſame.</p>
            <p>And his Majeſties further will and pleaſure is, that all Vintners and Retailers of Wines within the City of <hi>London,</hi> and within three miles thereof, for all ſuch Wines as they, ſince the eleventh day of <hi>June</hi> laſt, have ſold, or ſhall ſell in Groſſe, or by Retail, ſhall anſwer for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties uſe, to ſuch as are or ſhall be appointed therunto, the ſaid forty ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Tun, &amp; ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably for every leſſer quantity: And for the due payment thereof, his Majeſty doth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize ſuch perſons as he hath or ſhall under his great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> aſſign to receive the ſaid duty, and their Deputies to make ſearch in all Houſes, Vaults, Cellers, and other places where any Wines imported, bought or ſold, ſhall be, or ſhall be ſuſpected to be, which ought to pay the ſaid duty. And whereas divers Vintners of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and other Retailers of Wines in the Realme of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> have uſed of late to utter their Wines in Bottles, and other unſized and unlawfull meaſures, and at exceſſive rates; His Majeſties will and Pleaſure is, that from henceforth no ſort of Wines ſhall be ſold in any houſe or other place whatſoever, in Bottles, or other unſized or unlawfull meaſures, but only by the due and lawfull meaſure appointed for Wines, and at no greater rates then are or ſhall be hereafter allowed and ſet for the prizes of Wines yeerly, according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. And for the more equall ballancing and regulating the ſaid Trade of Wines thorowout the whole Kingdome, and the prevention of all frauds and abuſes therein, either in quality or quantity, his Majeſty doth expect that all Merchants, and other Retailers of Wines in all other his
<pb facs="tcp:28671:3"/>Majeſties Ports, Cities, Boroughs, Towns, and places whatſoever within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> Port and Town of <hi>Barwick,</hi> do and ſhall conform themſelves in all things to the order, rule and government of the Merchants and Vintners of <hi>London.</hi> And his Majeſtie doth further declare his pleaſure to be, That no wines which ſhall be ſold in groſſe in <hi>London,</hi> or within three miles thereof, ſhall hereafter be drawn or taken out of any Cellers, Vaults, Warehouſes, or other places, by any Porters, Carmen, Coopers, or any others, then by the Porters &amp; perſons therunto authorized by the ſaid Company of the Vintners of <hi>London,</hi> upon pain of his Majeſties high diſpleaſure, and of ſuch penalties as may be inflicted upon them. And whereas his Majeſty is informed, that for want of due regulation of Trade amongſt Merchants and others, trading to <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Dominions thereof, the prizes of the Wines and fruits there are much enhaunced, and his Majeſties Subjects, and their Ships, and Goods are oftentimes taken by Pyrats, and expoſed to many dangers, through want of Conſortſhip at Sea, his Majeſty intending reformation therein, hath inveſted the Merchants of <hi>London</hi> trading to <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp; the Dominions therof, with power to ſelect yeerly nine Merchants amongſt them, for the well ordering and government of their Trade both at home &amp; in forrain parts, and for the appointing of Ships from time to time. Wherefore his Majeſtie doth hereby declare His Royall will and pleaſure to be, and doth ſtraitly charge and command, that all his Subjects, Merchants of <hi>London</hi> trading to <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Dominions thereof, do from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth conform themſelves to all ſuch reaſonable and lawfull orders, as by the ſaid nine ſelected Merchants, or the greater part of them, ſhall from time to time be made, for the advancing of Trade into thoſe parts, with better regulation and ſafety: And this, as well under the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereby to be provided, as of his Majeſties diſpleaſure, and ſuch puniſhments as ſhall be meet for their contempts. And whereas his Majeſtie hath lately granted to the Company of Vintners of <hi>London,</hi> the diſpoſing and contracting for all Wine Licences, within the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Barwick;</hi> and being informed that divers Vintners and Retaylers of Wines are in Arrear, both in the payment of their fines and rents due to his Majeſtie, whereby their Licences are become void; His Majeſties will and pleaſure is, That if ſuch as be in Arrear ſhall not pay their ſeverall Arrearages before the firſt day of <hi>November</hi> next, then it ſhall be lawfull for the ſaid Company of Vintners to diſpoſe of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences to whom they ſhall think fit. And his Majeſtie doth further require, authorize and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as well all Iuſtices of Peace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Conſtables, Headboroughs, and other his Officers and Miniſters, as all his Cuſtomers, Controllers, Farmers of his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, Surveyors, Searchers, Waiters, and other the Officers of all and every his Ports, and the members thereof, that they, and every of them, in their ſeverall Offices and Places reſpectively, take care that his Majeſties royall will and pleaſure herein declared be from time to time duly obſerved, upon pain of his Majeſties high diſpleaſure, and the penalties to enſue therupon.</p>
